       " 'Slight and unimportant it could not be, or he would not have used such vehemence.',\n",
       " 'For to be exasperated by common matters is the part of the little-minded, morose, and peevish; just as it is that of the more redolent and sluggish to lose heart in weighty ones.',\n",
       " 'Such a one was not Paul.',\n",
       " 'What then was the offence which roused him?',\n",
       " 'it was grave and momentous, one which was estranging them all from Christ, as he himself says further on, “Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing;” Since Paul then saw the whole Galatian people in a state of excitement, a flame kindled against their Church, and the edifice shaken and tottering to its fall, filled with the mixed feelings of just anger and despondency, which he has expressed in the words, “I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my voice,”—But why does he not speak of his vocation rather than his apostolate, and say, “Paul” called “not by man?” Because here lay the whole question; for they said that the office of a teacher had been committed to him by men, namely by the Apostles, whom therefore it behooved him to obey.',\n",
       " 'But that it was not entrusted to him by men, Luke declares in the words, “As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul.” From this passage it is manifest“Who raised Him from the dead.”Wherefore is it, O Paul, that, wishing to bring these Judaizers to the faith, you introduce none of those great and illustrious topics which occur in your Epistle to the Philippians, as, “Who, being in the form of God, counted it not a prize to be on an equality with God,” But here the heretics insultingly exclaim, “Lo, the Father raises the Son!” For when once infected, they are wilfully deaf to all sublimer doctrines; and taking by itself and insisting on what is of a less exalted nature, and expressed in less exalted terms, either on account of the Son’s humanity, or in honor of the Father, or for some other temporary purpose, they outrage, I will not say the Scripture, but themselves.',\n",
       " 'I would fain ask such persons, why they say this?',\n",
       " 'do they hope to prove the Son weak and powerless to raise Nay, verily, faith in Him enabled the very shadows of those who believed in Him to effect the resurrection of the dead.',\n",
       " '“And all the brethren which are with me.”Why is it that he has on no other occasion in sending an epistle added this phrase?',\n",
       " 'For either he puts his own name only or that of two or three others, but here has mentioned the whole number and so has mentioned no one by name.On what account then does he this?They made the slanderous charge that he was singular in his preaching, and desired to introduce novelty in Christian teaching.',\n",
       " 'Wishing therefore to remove their suspicion, and to show he had many to support him in his doctrine, he has associated with himself “the brethren,” to show that what he wrote he wrote with their accord.“Unto the Churches of Galatia.”Thus it appears, that the flame of error had spread over not one or two cities merely, but the whole Galatian people.',\n",
       " 'Consider too the grave indignation contained in the phrase, “unto the Churches of Galatia:” he does not say, “to the beloved” or “to the sanctified,” and this omission of all names of affection or respect, and this speaking of them as a society merely, without the addition “Churches of God,” for it is simply “Churches of Galatia,” is strongly expressive of deep concern and sorrow.',\n",
       " 'Here at the outset, as well as elsewhere, he attacks their irregularities, and therefore gives them the name of “Churches,” in order to shame them, and reduce them to unity.',\n",
       " 'For persons split into many parties cannot properly claim this appellation, for the name of “Church” is a name of harmony and concord.“Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.”This he always mentions as indispensible, and in this Epistle to the Galatians especially; for since they were in danger of falling from grace he prays that they may recover it again, and since they had come to be at war with God, he beseeches God to restore them to the same peace.“God the Father.”Here again is a plain confutation of the heretics, who say that John in the opening of his Gospel, where he says “the Word was God,” used the wordBut the Name of the Son, as well as that of the Father, had been sufficient to declare to them these blessings.',\n",
       " 'This will appear, if we consider the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ with attention; for it is said, “thou shalt call His Name Jesus; for it is He that shall save His people from their sins;” Thus it appears, that the ministry which He undertook was free and uncompelled; that He was delivered up by Himself, not by another.',\n",
       " 'Let not therefore the words of John, “that the Father gave His only-begotten Son” “by the command,” but “according to the will,” for inasmuch as there is an unity of will in the Father and the Son, that which the Son wills, the Father wills also.“For our sins,”Another class of hereticsthings to come, and have become angels instead of men, and take part in the choirs of the heavenly powers?',\n",
       " 'What other proof do we need of an evil and depraved mind?“Why then,” they say, “does Paul call the present life evil?” In calling the present world [age] evil, he has accommodated himself to our usage, who are wont to say, “I have had a bad day,” thereby complaining not of the time itself, but of actions or circumstances.',\n",
       " 'And so Paul in complaining of evil principles of action has used these customary forms of speech; and he shows that Christ hath both delivered us from our offences, and secured us for the future.',\n",
       " 'The first he has declared in the words, “Who gave Himself for our sins;” and by adding, “that He might deliver us out of this present evil world,” he has pronounced our future safety.',\n",
       " 'For neither of these did the Law avail, but grace was sufficient for both.Since they were terrified by their notion that by deserting that old Law and adhering to the new, they should disobey God, who gave the Law, he corrects their error, and says, that this seemed good to the Father also: and not simply “the Father,” but “our Father,” which he does in order to affect them by showing that Christ has made His Father our Father.This too is new and unusual, for we never find the word, “Amen” placed at the beginning of an Epistle, but a good way on; here, however he has it in his beginning, to show that what he had already said contained a sufficient charge against the Galatians, and that his argument was complete, for a manifest offence does not require an elaborate crimination.',\n",
       " 'Having spoken of the Cross, and Resurrection, of redemption from sin and security for the future, of the purpose of the Father, and the will of the Son, of grace and peace and His whole gift, he concludes with an ascription of praise.Another reason for it is the exceeding astonishment into which he was thrown by the magnitude of the gift, the superabundance of the grace, the consideration who we were, and what God had wrought, and that at once and in a single moment of time.',\n",
       " 'Unable to express this in words, he breaks out into a doxology, sending up for the whole world an eulogium, not indeed worthy of the subject, but such as was possible to him.',\n",
       " 'Hence too he proceeds to use more vehement language; as if greatly kindled by a sense of the Divine benefits, for having said, “To whom be the glory for ever and ever, Amen,” he commences with a more severe reproof.Like the Jews who persecuted Christ, they imagined their observance of the Law was acceptable to the Father, and he therefore shows that in doing this they displeased not only Christ, but the Father also, for that they fell away thereby not from Christ only, but from the Father also.',\n",
       " 'As the old covenant was given not by the Father only, but also by the Son, so the covenant of grace proceeded from the Father as well as the Son, and Their every act is common: “All things whatsoever the Father hath are Mine.” “From Him that called you in the grace of Christ.”The calling is from the Father, but the cause of it is the Son.',\n",
       " 'He it is who hath brought about reconciliation and bestowed it as a gift, for we were not saved by works in righteousness: or I should rather say that these blessings proceed from Both; as He says, “Mine are Thine, and Thine are Mine.” And justly, for there is not another.That is to say, ye will not recognize another Gospel, so long as your mind is sane, so long as your vision remains healthy, and free from distorted and imaginary phantoms.',\n",
       " 'For as the disordered eye mistakes the object presented to it, so does the mind when made turbid by the confusion of evil thoughts.',\n",
       " 'Thus the madman confounds objects; but this insanity is more dangerous than a physical malady, for it works injury not in the regions of sense, but of the mind; it creates confusion not in the organ of bodily vision, but in the eye of the understanding.“And woulddon?',\n",
       " 'Assuredly not.',\n",
       " 'A want of zeal in small matters is the cause of all our calamities; and because slight errors escape fitting correction, greater ones creep in.',\n",
       " 'As in the body, a neglect of wounds generates fever, mortification, and death; so in the soul, slight evils overlooked open the door to graver ones.',\n",
       " 'It is accounted a trivial fault that one man should neglect fasting; that another, who is established in the pure faith, dissembling on account of circumstances, should surrender his bold profession of it, neither is this anything great or dreadful; that a third should be irritated, and threaten to depart from the true faith, is excused on the plea of passion and resentment.',\n",
       " 'Thus a thousand similar errors are daily introduced into the Church, and we are become a laughing-stock to Jews and Greeks, seeing that the Church is divided into a thousand parties.',\n",
       " 'But if a proper rebuke had at first been given to those who attempted slight perversions, and a deflection from the divine oracles, such a pestilence would not have been generated, nor such a storm have seized upon the Churches.',\n",
       " 'You will now understand why Paul calls circumcision a subversion of the Gospel.',\n",
       " 'There are many among us now, who fast on the same day as the Jews, and keep the sabbaths in the same manner; and we endure it nobly or rather ignobly and basely.',\n",
       " 'And why do I speak of Jews seeing that many Gentile customs are observed by some among us; omens, auguries, presages, distinctions of days, a curious attention to the circumstances of their children’s birth, and, as soon as they are born, tablets with impious inscriptions are placed upon their unhappy heads, thereby teaching them from the first to lay aside virtuous endeavors, and drawing part of them at least under the false domination of fate.See the Apostle’s wisdom; to obviate the objection that he was prompted by vainglory to applaud his own doctrine, he includes himself also in his anathema; and as they betook themselves to authority, that of James and John, he mentions angels also saying, “Tell me not of James and John; if one of the most exalted angels of heaven corrupt the Gospel, let him be anathema.” The phrase “of heaven” is purposely added, because priests are also called angels.',\n",
       " '“For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger [angel] of the Lord of hosts.” by God the Lord of all.',\n",
       " 'He says, if “any man” preach another Gospel to you than that which we have preached,—not “if this or that man:” and herein appears his prudence, and care of giving offence, for what needed there still any mention of names, when he had used such extensive terms as to embrace all, both in heaven and earth?',\n",
       " 'In that he anathemized evangelists and angels, he included every dignity, and his mention of himself included every intimacy and affinity.',\n",
       " '“Tell me not,” he exclaims, “that my fellow-apostles and colleagues have so spoken; I spare not myself if I preach such doctrine.” And he says this not as condemning the Apostles for swerving from the message they were commissioned to deliver; far from it, for he says, whether we or they thus preach; but to show, that in the discussion of truth the dignity of persons is not to be considered.Granting, says he, that I might deceive you by these doctrines, could I deceive God, who knows my yet unuttered thoughts, and to please whom is my unceasing endeavor?',\n",
       " 'See here the Apostolical spirit, the Evangelical loftiness!',\n",
       " 'So too he writes to the Corinthians, “For we are not again commending ourselves unto you, but speak as giving you occasion of glorying;” He thus expressed himself, as much with a view of withstanding their opinions, as in self-defence; for it becomes disciples to obey, not to judge, their master.',\n",
       " 'But now, says he, that the order is reversed, and ye sit as judges, know that I am but little concerned to defend myself before you; all, I do for God’s sake, and in order that I may answer to Him concerning my doctrine.',\n",
       " 'He who wishes to persuade men, is led to act tortuously and insincerely, and to employ deceit and falsehood, in order to engage the assent of his hearers.',\n",
       " 'But he who addresses himself to God, and desires to please Him, needs simplicity and purity of mind, for God cannot be deceived.',\n",
       " 'Whence it is plain that I have thus written to you not from the love of rule, or to gain disciples, or to receive honor at your hands.',\n",
       " 'My endeavor has been to please God, not man.',\n",
       " 'Were it otherwise, I should still consort with the Jews,You observe how sedulously he affirms that he was taught of Christ, who Himself, without human intervention, condescended to reveal to him all knowledge.',\n",
       " 'And if he were asked for his proof that God Himself thus immediately revealed to him these ineffable mysteries, he would instance his former manner of life, arguing that his conversion would not have been so sudden, had it not been by Divine revelation.',\n",
       " 'For when men have been vehement and eager on the contrary side, their conviction, if it is effected by human means, requires much time and ingenuity.',\n",
       " 'It is clear therefore that he, whose conversion is sudden, and who has been sobered in the very height of his madness, must have been vouchsafed a Divine revelation and teaching, and so have at once arrived at complete sanity.',\n",
       " 'On this account he is obliged to relate his former life, and to call the Galatians as witnesses of past events.',\n",
       " 'That the Only-Begotten Son of God had Himself from heaven vouchsafed to call me, says he, you who were not present, could not know, but that I was a persecutor you do know.',\n",
       " 'For my violence even reached your ears, and the distance between Palestine and Galatia is so great, that the report would not have extended thither, had not my acts exceeded all bounds and endurance.',\n",
       " 'Wherefore he says,Observe how he shrinks not from aggravating each point; not saying simply that he “persecuted” but “beyond measure,” and not only “persecuted” but “made havoc of it,” which signifies an attempt to extinguish, to pull down, to destroy, to annihilate, the Church.To obviate the notion that his persecution arose from passion, vain-glory, or enmity, he shows that he was actuated by zeal, not indeed “according to knowledge,” Here his object is to show, that it was by some secret providence that he was left for a time to himself.',\n",
       " 'For if he was set apart from his mother’s womb to be an Apostle and to be called to that ministry, yet was not actually called till that juncture, which summons he instantly obeyed, it is evident that God had some hidden reason for this delay.',\n",
       " 'What this purpose was, you are perhaps eager to learn from me, and primarily, why he was not called with the twelve.',\n",
       " 'But in order not to protract this discourse by digressing from that which is more pressing, I must entreat your love not to require all things from me, but to search for it by yourselves, and to beg of God to reveal it to you.',\n",
       " 'Moreover I partly discussed this subject when I discoursed before you on the change of his name from Saul to Paul; which, if you have forgotten, you will fully gather from a perusal of that volume.“And called me through His grace.”God indeed says that He called him on account of his excellent capacity, as He said to Ananias, “for he is a chosen vessel unto Me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings,” “To reveal His SonChrist says in another place, “No one knoweth who the Son is, save the Father; and who the Father is, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal Him.” “That I might preach Him among the Gentiles.” For not only his faith, but his election to the Apostolic office proceeded from God.',\n",
       " 'The object, says he, of His thus specially revealing Himself to me, was not only that I might myself behold Him, but that I might also manifest Him to others.',\n",
       " 'And he says not merely, “others,” but, “that I might preach Him among the Gentiles,” thus touching beforehand on that great ground of his defence which lay in the respective characters of the disciples; for it was necessary to preach differently to the Jews and to the heathen.“Immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood.”Here he alludes to the Apostles, naming them after their physical nature; however, that he may have meant to include all mankind, I shall not deny.These words weighed by themselves seem to breath an arrogant spirit, and to be foreign to the Apostolic temper.',\n",
       " 'For to give one’s suffrage for one’s self, and to admit no man to share one’s counsel, is a sign of folly.',\n",
       " 'It is said, “Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit?',\n",
       " 'there is more hope of a fool than of him;” Is it true, however, that he did not go up thither?Behold a fervent soul!',\n",
       " 'he longed to occupy regions not yet tilled, but lying in a wild state.',\n",
       " 'Had he remained with the Apostles, as he had nothing to learn, his preaching would have been straitened, for it behooved them to spread the word every where.',\n",
       " 'Thus this blessed man, fervent in spirit, straightway undertook to teach wild barbarians,But what great things did he not probably achieve in this city?',\n",
       " 'for he tells us that the governor under Aretas the king set guards about the whole of it, hoping to entrap this blessed man.',\n",
       " 'Which is a proof of the strongest kind that he was violently persecuted by the Jews.',\n",
       " 'Here, however, he says nothing of this, but mentioning his arrival and departure is silent concerning the events which there occurred, nor would he have mentioned them in the place I have referred to, What can be more lowly than such a soul?',\n",
       " 'After such successes, wanting nothing of Peter, not even his assent, but being of equal dignity with him, for at present I will say no more, he comes to him as his elder and superior.',\n",
       " 'And the only object of this journey was to visit Peter; thus he pays due respect to the Apostles, and esteems himself not only not their better but not their equal.',\n",
       " 'Which is plain from this journey, for Paul was induced to visit Peter by the same feeling from which many of our brethren sojourn with holy men: or rather by a humbler feeling for they do so for their own benefit, but this blessed man, not for his own instruction or correction, but merely for the sake of beholding and honoring Peter by his presence.',\n",
       " 'He says, “to visit Peter;” he does not say to see, To take a journey on account of him was a mark of respect; but to remain so many days, of friendship and the most earnest affection.See what great friends he was with Peter especially; on his account he left his home, and with him he tarried.',\n",
       " 'This I frequently repeat, and desire you to remember, that no one, when he hears what this Apostle seems to have spoken against Peter, may conceive a suspicion of him.',\n",
       " 'He premises this, that when he says, “I resisted Peter,” no one may suppose that these words imply enmity and contention; for he honored and loved his person more than all and took this journey for his sake only, not for any of the others.',\n",

       "'Oftentimes they pay as the penalty of plunder and rapaciousness, an untimely death; and not only suffer as a penalty the loss of the enjoyment of their gains, but go out of life having gained but little, and hell to boot.And what a hell do not these things deserve?This, at least if we chose, might more avail to startle us, yea, even than hell itself.For, even though hell were not, that we having been honored with such an honor, should be found base and unworthy of it, what punishment, what vengeance must not this carry with it?And to Christ, though He promises unnumbered blessings, not any one so much as gives any heed; whilst to the Devil, though promising nothing of the sort, but sending them on to hell, all yield themselves.Why, even were there no hell at all, the very thought of the kingdom, were it not enough to destroy and consume thee?This enmity no fresh Baptism, but hell itself awaits; no fresh remission, but searching trial.Nations and whole cities are swallowed up and destroyed, and myriads as many again are enslaved to the barbarians.If hell bring us not to our senses, yet let these things.A great thing indeed is this; nothing is so beneficial to us, nothing so deeply touches us: more availing this to convince our souls than the fear of hell itself.For hear what Christ saith: “Whosoever shall say to his brother, Thou fool, shall be in danger of the hell of fire.” Now the God of peace keep both your mind and your tongue, and fence you with a sure fence, even His fear, through Jesus Christ our Lord, with whom to the Father, together with the Holy Spirit, be glory forever.at that moment, tell me, does no recollection of hell come over thee?Paul, however, did not wish to mention any of these, but only this, “let this,” saith he, “be put away from you, with all malice.”For as I was saying that the departure from evil is sufficient to prevent our falling into hell, whilst I was speaking, there stole upon me a certain awful sentence, which does not merely bring down vengeance on them that dare to commit evil, but which also punishes those who omit any opportunity of doing good.“For what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity, or what communion hath light with darkness?” “Because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience.”Because of “fornication,” he means, because of “covetousness,” because of “uncleanness,” or both because of these things, and because of the “deceit,”Observe how wisely he urges them forward; first, from the thought of Christ, that ye love one another, and do injury to no man; then, on the other hand, from the thought of punishment and hell-fire.Because Christ too so willeth, as when He saith, “If thou make a supper or a dinner, call not thy friends, neither thy kinsmen, but the maimed, the lame, the blind, that cannot recompense thee.” feed the fire of hell.You then lay under your lofty ceiling; but now in the fire of hell.These things let the rich men hear.His poverty hindered not the one in obtaining the kingdom; his riches helped not the other to avoid hell.Paul might depart to Christ, and would not, Christ whom he so desired, as for his sake to choose even hell,You see that this explains the word “abide with you.” Behold his humility.For this cause does God threaten hell, that none may fall into hell, that we all may obtain the kingdom; for this cause we too make mention continually of hell, that we may thrust you onward towards the kingdom, that when we have softened your minds by fear, we may bring you to act worthily of the kingdom.For, as I have often said, God does not regard the amount of the gifts, but the will of the givers; it is possible even for one in poverty, who has given but little, to bear off all, for God requires a measure proportioned to our ability, neither will riches secure heaven to us, nor poverty, hell; but a good or a bad will, either one or the other.I care not for hell henceforth; whatever can be said, having fallen from so great glory, now and henceforth consider hell to be nothing to this falling away.For were you to make mention of hells innumerable, you would name nothing equal to that pain which the soul sustaineth, when all the world is in confusion, when the trumpets are sounding, when the Angels are rushing forward, the first, then the second, then the third, then ten thousand ranks, are pouring forth upon the earth; then the Cherubim, and many are these and infinite; the Seraphim; when He Himself is coming, with His ineffable glory; when those meet Him, who had gone to gather the elect into the midst; when Paul and his companions, and all who in his time had been approved, are crowned, are proclaimed aloud, are honored by the King, before all His heavenly host.For if hell did not exist, how fearful a thing it is, that the one part should be honored, and the other dishonored!Hell, I confess, is intolerable, yea, very intolerable, but more intolerable than it is the loss of the Kingdom.When he receiveth the one part and leadeth them to His Father in heaven, and rejecteth the other, whom Angels take and drag against their will, weeping, and hanging down their heads, to the fire of hell, when they have first been made a spectacle to the whole world, what grief, think you, is there?Meanwhile, saith he, I will not torment my soul with the expectation of hell, and, if there be a hell, I will persuade it that there is none; meanwhile I will live here in luxury!If when thou hast sinned thou believest that there is a hell, thou wilt depart with the penalty of thy sins only to pay; but if thou add this further impiety, thou wilt also for thine impiety, and for this thy thought, suffer the uttermost punishment; and what was a cold and shortlived comfort to thee, will be a ground for thy being punished for ever.Thou hast sinned: be it so: why dost thou encourage others also to sin, by saying that there is no hell?For his substance casteth him not into hell, nor leadeth him into the kingdom, but men themselves: and we neither love nor hate any one so far as he is man, but so far as he is such or such a man.He used to say nothing before these words, but thus, “We give Thee thanks for all Thy benefits bestowed upon us the unworthy, from the first day until the present, for what we know, and what we know not, for the seen, for the unseen, for those in deed, those in word, those with our wills, those against our wills, for all that have been bestowed upon the unworthy, even us; for tribulations, for refreshments, for hell, for punishment, for the kingdom of heaven.And He doeth not this Himself alone, but He thus exhorteth others also, saying, “Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for Me.” In that sight many have been partakers, and those who have not so been, Christ the rather calls blessed, saying, “Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed” hell,Remember we these tears: thus let us bring up our daughters, thus our sons; weeping when we see them in evil.Such was Paul, who would willingly have given his own soul, even though not asked, nay would have plunged into hellI wish to give you an example of friendship.On this account it is that He compares His coming with the days of Noah, because as some disbelieved in that deluge, so will they in the deluge of hell.If any one disbelieves hell, let him consider Sodom, let him reflect upon Gomorrah, the vengeance that has been inflicted, and which yet remains.And is it not grievous, when you say that there is no hell, but that God has merely threatened it?For they knew not of a hell, therefore they were visited with punishments following close at their heels.Read over Josephus, and you will learn that whole tragedy, if perchance we may persuade you from these things, that there is a hell.If then there be not a hell, where is His justice, where His impartiality, that respects not persons?How was it then that they did not suffer the same punishment?Do we then persuade you that there is a hell, or do you need more examples?But it cannot be that there is not punishment and a hell.But on this subject I will rather discourse at some other season, that we may not confuse the discourses concerning hell.For it is no small advantage to be persuaded concerning hell.Just as it is said, “sons of destruction” and “sons of hell.” Wherefore Christ also said to the Pharisees, “Woe unto you—for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is become so, ye make him a son of hell.” Here he shows, that to be in the day depends on ourselves.These are hastening to heaven, those to hell.And perhaps indeed many of them will even laugh at the things that are said by us.Think of Hell.Let us, however, even thus consider the blessings of the kingdom, the miseries of hell, and thus regulate and school ourselves; let us in this way bring ourselves to the things that are to be practiced.When you see anything terrible, think of hell, and you will deride it.For if the sight only of a dead body so depresses the mind, how much more must hell and the fire unquenchable, how much more the worm that never dieth.If we always think of hell, we shall not soon fall into it.But he who converses about hell incurs no dangers, and renders it more sober.But dost thou fear the offensiveness of such words?Hast thou then, if thou art silent, extinguished hell?It is not possible that a soul anxious about hell should readily sin.For hear the most excellent advice, “Remember,” it says, “thy latter end” Let us not remember the kingdom so much as hell.No one of those who have hell before their eyes will fall into hell.No one of those who despise hell will escape hell.Nothing is so profitable as to converse concerning hell.If no one endures a discourse concerning hell, it is evident, that if persecution came on, no one would ever stand firm against fire, against sword.Because he had been in the practice of despising hell, for the sake of what was God’s will.He thought even the experience of hell to be nothing for the sake of the love of Christ; while we do not even endure a discourse concerning it for our own advantage.But like a horse obedient to the bridle, having the thought of hell seated upon it, walking orderly, it will both speak and utter things profitable; and neither youth nor riches, nor an orphan state, nor any other thing, will be able to injure it, having its reason so firm and able to hold out against everything.By these discourses let us regulate as well ourselves as our wives too, our servants, our children, our friends, and, if possible, our enemies.But if you are speaking against luxury, and introduce discourse concerning hell, the thing will cheer you, and beget much pleasure.For when you consider that luxury will not be able to defend us at all against that fire, you will not seek after it; but if you reflect that it is wont to kindle it even more, you will not only not seek, but will turn from it and reject it.Let us not avoid discourses concerning hell, that we may avoid hell.Let us keep hell before our eyes.Is it not then the extreme of folly to be solicitous about a thing so worthless, to do anything whatever, to risk your salvation for it, to make a mock at Hell, to set God at defiance, to overlook Christ hungering?Let us therefore listen to the threatenings of hell fire, that we may be benefited by the wholesome fear of it.So that, as I have ever said, the threatenings of hell show the care of God for us no less than the promises of heaven.For say not they are under necessity, when thou too art under a necessity in the fear of hell.Is not hell then justly threatened, and the fire, and the worm that dieth not?And that thou mayest learn by the very examples, at one time he punished Pharaoh, at another time He brought a flood of water upon the earth, and that utter destruction, and again at another time a flood of fire: and even now we see in many instances the wicked suffering vengeance, and punishments, which things are figures of Hell.For lest we should slumber and be slothful, and forget His word, He awakens our minds by deeds; showing us, even here, courts of justice, judgment seats, and trials.Seest thou that a failure in alms-giving is enough to cast a man into hell fire?For instance, “Whosoever shall say to his brother, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.” “To Titus mine ownWhat is “after the common faith”?For one good act in his episcopal office is sufficient to raise him to heaven and one error to sink him to hell itself.I lately discoursed with you about Hell, and I deferred my argument upon the lovingkindness of God.That there will, then, be a hell, we have, as I think, sufficiently proved, bringing forward the deluge, and former evils, and arguing that it is not possible that He who performed these things should leave the men of the present age unpunished.'"

       "'Oftentimes they pay as the penalty of plunder and rapaciousness, an untimely death; and not only suffer as a penalty the loss of the enjoyment of their gains, but go out of life having gained but little, and hell to boot. A great thing indeed is this; nothing is so beneficial to us, nothing so deeply touches us: more availing this to convince our souls than the fear of hell itself. “For what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity, or what communion hath light with darkness?” “ ”Because of “fornication,” he means, because of “covetousness,” because of “uncleanness,” or both because of these things, and because of the “deceit,”Observe how wisely he urges them forward; first, from the thought of Christ, that ye love one another, and do injury to no man; then, on the other hand, from the thought of punishment and hell-fire. His poverty hindered not the one in obtaining the kingdom; his riches helped not the other to avoid hell. For, as I have often said, God does not regard the amount of the gifts, but the will of the givers; it is possible even for one in poverty, who has given but little, to bear off all, for God requires a measure proportioned to our ability, neither will riches secure heaven to us, nor poverty, hell; but a good or a bad will, either one or the other. Such was Paul, who would willingly have given his own soul, even though not asked, nay would have plunged into hellI wish to give you an example of friendship. And perhaps indeed many of them will even laugh at the things that are said by us. But he who converses about hell incurs no dangers, and renders it more sober. But like a horse obedient to the bridle, having the thought of hell seated upon it, walking orderly, it will both speak and utter things profitable; and neither youth nor riches, nor an orphan state, nor any other thing, will be able to injure it, having its reason so firm and able to hold out against everything. For say not they are under necessity, when thou too art under a necessity in the fear of hell. That there will, then, be a hell, we have, as I think, sufficiently proved, bringing forward the deluge, and former evils, and arguing that it is not possible that He who performed these things should leave the men of the present age unpunished.'"

       " 'it was grave and momentous, one which was estranging them all from Christ, as he himself says further on, “Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing;” Since Paul then saw the whole Galatian people in a state of excitement, a flame kindled against their Church, and the edifice shaken and tottering to its fall, filled with the mixed feelings of just anger and despondency, which he has expressed in the words, “I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my voice,”—But why does he not speak of his vocation rather than his apostolate, and say, “Paul” called “not by man?” Because here lay the whole question; for they said that the office of a teacher had been committed to him by men, namely by the Apostles, whom therefore it behooved him to obey.',\n",
       " 'But that it was not entrusted to him by men, Luke declares in the words, “As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul.” From this passage it is manifest“Who raised Him from the dead.”Wherefore is it, O Paul, that, wishing to bring these Judaizers to the faith, you introduce none of those great and illustrious topics which occur in your Epistle to the Philippians, as, “Who, being in the form of God, counted it not a prize to be on an equality with God,” But here the heretics insultingly exclaim, “Lo, the Father raises the Son!” For when once infected, they are wilfully deaf to all sublimer doctrines; and taking by itself and insisting on what is of a less exalted nature, and expressed in less exalted terms, either on account of the Son’s humanity, or in honor of the Father, or for some other temporary purpose, they outrage, I will not say the Scripture, but themselves.',\n",
       " 'I would fain ask such persons, why they say this?',\n",

       " 'For either he puts his own name only or that of two or three others, but here has mentioned the whole number and so has mentioned no one by name.On what account then does he this?They made the slanderous charge that he was singular in his preaching, and desired to introduce novelty in Christian teaching.',\n",
       " 'Wishing therefore to remove their suspicion, and to show he had many to support him in his doctrine, he has associated with himself “the brethren,” to show that what he wrote he wrote with their accord.“Unto the Churches of Galatia.”Thus it appears, that the flame of error had spread over not one or two cities merely, but the whole Galatian people.',\n",
       " 'Consider too the grave indignation contained in the phrase, “unto the Churches of Galatia:” he does not say, “to the beloved” or “to the sanctified,” and this omission of all names of affection or respect, and this speaking of them as a society merely, without the addition “Churches of God,” for it is simply “Churches of Galatia,” is strongly expressive of deep concern and sorrow.',\n",
       " 'Here at the outset, as well as elsewhere, he attacks their irregularities, and therefore gives them the name of “Churches,” in order to shame them, and reduce them to unity.',\n",
       " 'For persons split into many parties cannot properly claim this appellation, for the name of “Church” is a name of harmony and concord.“Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.”This he always mentions as indispensible, and in this Epistle to the Galatians especially; for since they were in danger of falling from grace he prays that they may recover it again, and since they had come to be at war with God, he beseeches God to restore them to the same peace.“God the Father.”Here again is a plain confutation of the heretics, who say that John in the opening of his Gospel, where he says “the Word was God,” used the wordBut the Name of the Son, as well as that of the Father, had been sufficient to declare to them these blessings.',\n",
       " 'This will appear, if we consider the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ with attention; for it is said, “thou shalt call His Name Jesus; for it is He that shall save His people from their sins;” Thus it appears, that the ministry which He undertook was free and uncompelled; that He was delivered up by Himself, not by another.',\n",
       " 'Let not therefore the words of John, “that the Father gave His only-begotten Son” “by the command,” but “according to the will,” for inasmuch as there is an unity of will in the Father and the Son, that which the Son wills, the Father wills also.“For our sins,”Another class of hereticsthings to come, and have become angels instead of men, and take part in the choirs of the heavenly powers?',\n",
       " 'What other proof do we need of an evil and depraved mind?“Why then,” they say, “does Paul call the present life evil?” In calling the present world [age] evil, he has accommodated himself to our usage, who are wont to say, “I have had a bad day,” thereby complaining not of the time itself, but of actions or circumstances.',\n",
       " 'And so Paul in complaining of evil principles of action has used these customary forms of speech; and he shows that Christ hath both delivered us from our offences, and secured us for the future.',\n",
       " 'The first he has declared in the words, “Who gave Himself for our sins;” and by adding, “that He might deliver us out of this present evil world,” he has pronounced our future safety.',\n",
       " 'For neither of these did the Law avail, but grace was sufficient for both.Since they were terrified by their notion that by deserting that old Law and adhering to the new, they should disobey God, who gave the Law, he corrects their error, and says, that this seemed good to the Father also: and not simply “the Father,” but “our Father,” which he does in order to affect them by showing that Christ has made His Father our Father.This too is new and unusual, for we never find the word, “Amen” placed at the beginning of an Epistle, but a good way on; here, however he has it in his beginning, to show that what he had already said contained a sufficient charge against the Galatians, and that his argument was complete, for a manifest offence does not require an elaborate crimination.',\n",
       " 'Having spoken of the Cross, and Resurrection, of redemption from sin and security for the future, of the purpose of the Father, and the will of the Son, of grace and peace and His whole gift, he concludes with an ascription of praise.Another reason for it is the exceeding astonishment into which he was thrown by the magnitude of the gift, the superabundance of the grace, the consideration who we were, and what God had wrought, and that at once and in a single moment of time.',\n",
       " 'Unable to express this in words, he breaks out into a doxology, sending up for the whole world an eulogium, not indeed worthy of the subject, but such as was possible to him.',\n",
       " 'Hence too he proceeds to use more vehement language; as if greatly kindled by a sense of the Divine benefits, for having said, “To whom be the glory for ever and ever, Amen,” he commences with a more severe reproof.Like the Jews who persecuted Christ, they imagined their observance of the Law was acceptable to the Father, and he therefore shows that in doing this they displeased not only Christ, but the Father also, for that they fell away thereby not from Christ only, but from the Father also.',\n",
       " 'As the old covenant was given not by the Father only, but also by the Son, so the covenant of grace proceeded from the Father as well as the Son, and Their every act is common: “All things whatsoever the Father hath are Mine.” “From Him that called you in the grace of Christ.”The calling is from the Father, but the cause of it is the Son.',\n",
       " 'He it is who hath brought about reconciliation and bestowed it as a gift, for we were not saved by works in righteousness: or I should rather say that these blessings proceed from Both; as He says, “Mine are Thine, and Thine are Mine.” And justly, for there is not another.That is to say, ye will not recognize another Gospel, so long as your mind is sane, so long as your vision remains healthy, and free from distorted and imaginary phantoms.',\n",
       " 'For as the disordered eye mistakes the object presented to it, so does the mind when made turbid by the confusion of evil thoughts.',\n",
       " 'Thus the madman confounds objects; but this insanity is more dangerous than a physical malady, for it works injury not in the regions of sense, but of the mind; it creates confusion not in the organ of bodily vision, but in the eye of the understanding.“And woulddon?',\n",
       " 'Assuredly not.',\n",
       " 'A want of zeal in small matters is the cause of all our calamities; and because slight errors escape fitting correction, greater ones creep in.',\n",
       " 'As in the body, a neglect of wounds generates fever, mortification, and death; so in the soul, slight evils overlooked open the door to graver ones.',\n",
       " 'It is accounted a trivial fault that one man should neglect fasting; that another, who is established in the pure faith, dissembling on account of circumstances, should surrender his bold profession of it, neither is this anything great or dreadful; that a third should be irritated, and threaten to depart from the true faith, is excused on the plea of passion and resentment.',\n",
       " 'Thus a thousand similar errors are daily introduced into the Church, and we are become a laughing-stock to Jews and Greeks, seeing that the Church is divided into a thousand parties.',\n",
       " 'But if a proper rebuke had at first been given to those who attempted slight perversions, and a deflection from the divine oracles, such a pestilence would not have been generated, nor such a storm have seized upon the Churches.',\n",
       " 'You will now understand why Paul calls circumcision a subversion of the Gospel.',\n",
       " 'There are many among us now, who fast on the same day as the Jews, and keep the sabbaths in the same manner; and we endure it nobly or rather ignobly and basely.',\n",
       " 'And why do I speak of Jews seeing that many Gentile customs are observed by some among us; omens, auguries, presages, distinctions of days, a curious attention to the circumstances of their children’s birth, and, as soon as they are born, tablets with impious inscriptions are placed upon their unhappy heads, thereby teaching them from the first to lay aside virtuous endeavors, and drawing part of them at least under the false domination of fate.See the Apostle’s wisdom; to obviate the objection that he was prompted by vainglory to applaud his own doctrine, he includes himself also in his anathema; and as they betook themselves to authority, that of James and John, he mentions angels also saying, “Tell me not of James and John; if one of the most exalted angels of heaven corrupt the Gospel, let him be anathema.” The phrase “of heaven” is purposely added, because priests are also called angels.',\n",
       " '“For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger [angel] of the Lord of hosts.” by God the Lord of all.',\n",
       " 'He says, if “any man” preach another Gospel to you than that which we have preached,—not “if this or that man:” and herein appears his prudence, and care of giving offence, for what needed there still any mention of names, when he had used such extensive terms as to embrace all, both in heaven and earth?',\n",
       " 'In that he anathemized evangelists and angels, he included every dignity, and his mention of himself included every intimacy and affinity.',\n",
       " '“Tell me not,” he exclaims, “that my fellow-apostles and colleagues have so spoken; I spare not myself if I preach such doctrine.” And he says this not as condemning the Apostles for swerving from the message they were commissioned to deliver; far from it, for he says, whether we or they thus preach; but to show, that in the discussion of truth the dignity of persons is not to be considered.Granting, says he, that I might deceive you by these doctrines, could I deceive God, who knows my yet unuttered thoughts, and to please whom is my unceasing endeavor?',\n",
       " 'See here the Apostolical spirit, the Evangelical loftiness!',\n",
       " 'So too he writes to the Corinthians, “For we are not again commending ourselves unto you, but speak as giving you occasion of glorying;” He thus expressed himself, as much with a view of withstanding their opinions, as in self-defence; for it becomes disciples to obey, not to judge, their master.',\n",
       " 'But now, says he, that the order is reversed, and ye sit as judges, know that I am but little concerned to defend myself before you; all, I do for God’s sake, and in order that I may answer to Him concerning my doctrine.',\n",
       " 'He who wishes to persuade men, is led to act tortuously and insincerely, and to employ deceit and falsehood, in order to engage the assent of his hearers.',\n",
       " 'But he who addresses himself to God, and desires to please Him, needs simplicity and purity of mind, for God cannot be deceived.',\n",
       " 'Whence it is plain that I have thus written to you not from the love of rule, or to gain disciples, or to receive honor at your hands.',\n",
       " 'My endeavor has been to please God, not man.',\n",
       " 'Were it otherwise, I should still consort with the Jews,You observe how sedulously he affirms that he was taught of Christ, who Himself, without human intervention, condescended to reveal to him all knowledge.',\n",
       " 'And if he were asked for his proof that God Himself thus immediately revealed to him these ineffable mysteries, he would instance his former manner of life, arguing that his conversion would not have been so sudden, had it not been by Divine revelation.',\n",
       " 'For when men have been vehement and eager on the contrary side, their conviction, if it is effected by human means, requires much time and ingenuity.',\n",
       " 'It is clear therefore that he, whose conversion is sudden, and who has been sobered in the very height of his madness, must have been vouchsafed a Divine revelation and teaching, and so have at once arrived at complete sanity.',\n",
       " 'On this account he is obliged to relate his former life, and to call the Galatians as witnesses of past events.',\n",
       " 'That the Only-Begotten Son of God had Himself from heaven vouchsafed to call me, says he, you who were not present, could not know, but that I was a persecutor you do know.',\n",
       " 'For my violence even reached your ears, and the distance between Palestine and Galatia is so great, that the report would not have extended thither, had not my acts exceeded all bounds and endurance.',\n",
       " 'Wherefore he says,Observe how he shrinks not from aggravating each point; not saying simply that he “persecuted” but “beyond measure,” and not only “persecuted” but “made havoc of it,” which signifies an attempt to extinguish, to pull down, to destroy, to annihilate, the Church.To obviate the notion that his persecution arose from passion, vain-glory, or enmity, he shows that he was actuated by zeal, not indeed “according to knowledge,” Here his object is to show, that it was by some secret providence that he was left for a time to himself.',\n",
       " 'For if he was set apart from his mother’s womb to be an Apostle and to be called to that ministry, yet was not actually called till that juncture, which summons he instantly obeyed, it is evident that God had some hidden reason for this delay.',\n",
       " 'What this purpose was, you are perhaps eager to learn from me, and primarily, why he was not called with the twelve.',\n",
       " 'But in order not to protract this discourse by digressing from that which is more pressing, I must entreat your love not to require all things from me, but to search for it by yourselves, and to beg of God to reveal it to you.',\n",
       " 'Moreover I partly discussed this subject when I discoursed before you on the change of his name from Saul to Paul; which, if you have forgotten, you will fully gather from a perusal of that volume.“And called me through His grace.”God indeed says that He called him on account of his excellent capacity, as He said to Ananias, “for he is a chosen vessel unto Me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings,” “To reveal His SonChrist says in another place, “No one knoweth who the Son is, save the Father; and who the Father is, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal Him.” “That I might preach Him among the Gentiles.” For not only his faith, but his election to the Apostolic office proceeded from God.',\n",
       " 'The object, says he, of His thus specially revealing Himself to me, was not only that I might myself behold Him, but that I might also manifest Him to others.',\n",
       " 'And he says not merely, “others,” but, “that I might preach Him among the Gentiles,” thus touching beforehand on that great ground of his defence which lay in the respective characters of the disciples; for it was necessary to preach differently to the Jews and to the heathen.“Immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood.”Here he alludes to the Apostles, naming them after their physical nature; however, that he may have meant to include all mankind, I shall not deny.These words weighed by themselves seem to breath an arrogant spirit, and to be foreign to the Apostolic temper.',\n",
       " 'For to give one’s suffrage for one’s self, and to admit no man to share one’s counsel, is a sign of folly.',\n",
       " 'It is said, “Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit?',\n",
       " 'there is more hope of a fool than of him;” Is it true, however, that he did not go up thither?Behold a fervent soul!',\n",
       " 'he longed to occupy regions not yet tilled, but lying in a wild state.',\n",
       " 'Had he remained with the Apostles, as he had nothing to learn, his preaching would have been straitened, for it behooved them to spread the word every where.',\n",
       " 'Thus this blessed man, fervent in spirit, straightway undertook to teach wild barbarians,But what great things did he not probably achieve in this city?',\n",
       " 'for he tells us that the governor under Aretas the king set guards about the whole of it, hoping to entrap this blessed man.',\n",
       " 'Which is a proof of the strongest kind that he was violently persecuted by the Jews.',\n",
       " 'Here, however, he says nothing of this, but mentioning his arrival and departure is silent concerning the events which there occurred, nor would he have mentioned them in the place I have referred to, What can be more lowly than such a soul?',\n",
       " 'After such successes, wanting nothing of Peter, not even his assent, but being of equal dignity with him, for at present I will say no more, he comes to him as his elder and superior.',\n",
       " 'And the only object of this journey was to visit Peter; thus he pays due respect to the Apostles, and esteems himself not only not their better but not their equal.',\n",
       " 'Which is plain from this journey, for Paul was induced to visit Peter by the same feeling from which many of our brethren sojourn with holy men: or rather by a humbler feeling for they do so for their own benefit, but this blessed man, not for his own instruction or correction, but merely for the sake of beholding and honoring Peter by his presence.',\n",
       " 'He says, “to visit Peter;” he does not say to see, To take a journey on account of him was a mark of respect; but to remain so many days, of friendship and the most earnest affection.See what great friends he was with Peter especially; on his account he left his home, and with him he tarried.',\n",
       " 'This I frequently repeat, and desire you to remember, that no one, when he hears what this Apostle seems to have spoken against Peter, may conceive a suspicion of him.',\n",
       " 'He premises this, that when he says, “I resisted Peter,” no one may suppose that these words imply enmity and contention; for he honored and loved his person more than all and took this journey for his sake only, not for any of the others.',\n",
       " '“But other of the Apostles saw I none, save James.” “I saw him merely, I did not learn from him,” he means.',\n",
       " 'But observe how honorably he mentions him, he says not “James” merely, but adds this illustrious title, so free is he from all envy.',\n",
       " 'Had he only wished to point out whom he meant, he might have shown this by another appellation, and called him the son of Cleophas, as the Evangelist does.Observe throughout the transparent humility of this holy soul; his earnestness in his own vindication is as great as if he had to render an account of his deeds, and was pleading for his life in a court of justice.After his interview with Peter, he resumes his preaching and the task which lay before him, avoiding Judæa, both because of his mission being to the Gentiles, and of his unwillingness to “build upon another man’s foundation.” Wherefore there was not even a chance meeting, as appears from what follows.What modesty in thus again mentioning the facts of his persecuting and laying waste the Church, and in thus making infamous his former life, while he passes over the illustrious deeds he was about to achieve!',\n",
       " 'He might have told, had he wished it, all his successes, but he mentions none of these and stepping with one word over a vast expanse, he says merely, “I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;” and, “they had heard, that he, which once persecuted us, now preacheth the faith of which he once made havoc.” The purpose of the words, “I was unknown to the Churches of Judæa,” is to show, that so far from preaching to them the necessity of circumcision, he was not known to them even by sight.What is this, O Paul!',\n",
       " 'thou who neither at the beginning nor after three years wouldest confer with the Apostles, dost thou now confer with them, after fourteen years are past, lest thou shouldest be running in vain?',\n",
       " 'Better would it have been to have done so at first, than after so many years; and why didst thou run at all, if not satisfied that thou wert not running in vain?',\n",
       " 'Who would be so senseless as to preach for so many years, without being sure that his preaching was true?',\n",
       " 'And what enhances the difficulty is, that he says he went up by revelation; this difficulty, however, will afford a solution of the former one.',\n",
       " 'Had he gone up of his own accord, it would have been most unreasonable, nor is it possible that this blessed soul should have fallen into such folly; for it is himself who says, “I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so fight I, as not beating the air.” Wherefore he says that he went up by revelation,are informed of thee, that thou teachest to forsake the law.” What means, “being a Greek?” Of Greek extraction, and not circumcised; for not only did I so preach but Titus so acted, nor did the Apostles compel him to be circumcised.',\n",
       " 'A plain proof this that the Apostles did not condemn Paul’s doctrine or his practice.',\n",
       " 'Nay more, even the urgent representations of the adverse party, who were aware of these facts, did not oblige the Apostles to enjoin circumcision, as appears by his own words,—Here arises a very important question, Who were these false brethren?He points out their hostility by calling them spies; for the sole object of a spy is to obtain for himself facilities of devastation and destruction, by becoming acquainted with his adversary’s position.',\n",
       " 'And this is what those did, who wished to bring the disciples back to their old servitude.',\n",
       " 'Hence too appears how very contrary their purpose was to that of the Apostles; the latter made concessions that they might gradually extricate them from their servitude, but the former plotted to subject them to one more severe.',\n",
       " 'Therefore they looked round and observed accurately and made themselves busybodies to find out who were uncircumcised; as Paul says, “they came in privily to spy out our liberty,” thus pointing out their machinations not only by the term “spies,” but by this expression of a furtive entrance and creeping in.Observe the force and emphasis of the phrase; he says not, “by argument,” but, “by subjection,” for their object was not to teach good doctrine, but to subjugate and enslave them.',\n",
       " 'Wherefore, says he, we yielded to the Apostles, but not to these.That we may confirm, says he, by our deeds what we have already declared by words,—namely, that the “old things are passed away, behold they are become new;” and that “if any man is in Christ he is a new creature;” Here he not only does not defend the Apostles, but even presses hard upon those holy men, for the benefit of the weak.',\n",
       " 'His meaning is this: although they permit circumcision, they shall render an account to God, for God will not accept their persons, because they are great and in station.',\n",
       " 'But he does not speak so plainly, but with caution.',\n",
       " 'He says not, if they vitiate their doctrine, and swerve from the appointed rule of their preaching, they shall be judged with the utmost rigor, and suffer punishment; but he alludes to them more reverently, in the words, “of those who were reputed to be somewhat, whatsoever they were.” He says not, “whatsoever they ‘are,’” but “were,” showing that they too had thenceforthThat is to say, when told of my proceedings, they added nothing, they corrected nothing, and though aware that the object of my journey was to communicate with them, that I had come by revelation of the Spirit, and that I had Titus with me who was uncircumcised, they neither circumcised him, nor imparted to me any additional knowledge.Some hold his meaning to be, not only that the Apostles did not instruct him, but that they were instructed by him.',\n",
       " 'But I would not say this, for what could they, each of whom was himself perfectly instructed, have learnt from him?',\n",
       " 'He does not therefore intend this by the expression, “contrariwise,” but that so far were they from blaming, that they praised him: for praise is the contrary of blame.',\n",
       " 'Some would probably here reply: Why did not the Apostles, if they praised your procedure, as the proper consequence abolish circumcision?The Circumcision and Uncircumcision; meaning, not the things themselves, but the nations known by these distinctions; wherefore he adds,He calls the Gentiles the Uncircumcision and the Jews the Circumcision, and declares his own rank to be equal to that of the Apostles; and, by comparing himself with their Leader not with the others, he shows that the dignity of each was the same.',\n",
       " 'After he had established the proof of their unanimity, he takes courage, and proceeds confidently in his argument, not stopping at the Apostles, but advances to Christ Himself, and to the grace which He had conferred upon him, and calls the Apostles as his witnesses, saying,He says not when they “heard,” but when they “perceived,” that is, were assured by the facts themselves, “they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship.” Observe how he gradually proves that his doctrine was ratified both by Christ and by the Apostles.',\n",
       " 'For grace would neither have been implanted, nor been operative in him, had not his preaching been approved by Christ.',\n",
       " 'Where it was for the purpose of comparison with himself, he mentioned Peter alone; here, when he calls them as witnesses, he names the three together, “Cephas, James, John,” and with an encomium, “who were reputed to be pillars.” Here again the expression “who were reputed” does not impugn the reality of the fact, but adopts the estimate of others, and implies that these great and distinguished men, whose fame was universal, bare witness that his preaching was ratified by Christ, that they were practically informed and convinced by experience concerning it.',\n",
